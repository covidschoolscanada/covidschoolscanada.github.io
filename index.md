title: Our Goals
---

**Work closely with and advocate to governments:**

* To actively promote and educate the use of effective, re-usable, non-medical face coverings in addition to physical distancing and hand hygiene. To enhance public health safety, we advocate for the addition of masks in:

<span class="indent">A: All public/enclosed indoor spaces</span><br>
<span class="indent">C: Crowds</span><br>
<span class="indent">T: public Transit</span>

* To mandate compulsory use of face coverings in the above high-risk settings, for the protection of self and others.
* To empower people to wear face masks properly while understanding that EXCEPTIONS must be made for those with medical contraindications and young children.
* To focus on public education about safe masking practices, and to supply to those in need of them rather than fines/penalties.
